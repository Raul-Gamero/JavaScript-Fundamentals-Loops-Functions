# JavaScript Advanced Practice – Loops & Functions

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **advanced JavaScript homework** focused strictly on:
- Loops and Iteration
- Functions

The exercises are designed to improve **algorithmic thinking**, **data processing**, and **code structuring** using only loops and functions.

⚠️ No conditionals and no array methods are allowed.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, students will be able to:
- Design reusable and modular functions
- Solve problems using only loops
- Work with arrays and strings using iteration
- Build simple algorithms without built-in helpers
- Understand time complexity at a basic level

---

## 🛠️ Technical Constraints
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Run using Node.js
- No `if`, `else`, `switch`, or ternary operators
- No array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`)
- Only:
  - functions
  - loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
  - variables and operators

## 🧪 Exercises

### 1️⃣ Custom Array Length
Create a function that:
- Receives an array
- Calculates its length **without using `.length`**
- Returns the length

---

### 2️⃣ Manual Index Access
Create a function that:
- Receives an array
- Prints each element **with its index**
- Index must be calculated manually using a loop

---

### 3️⃣ Array Sum (No Helpers)
Create a function that:
- Receives an array of numbers
- Uses a loop to calculate the sum
- Returns the result

---

### 4️⃣ Maximum Value
Create a function that:
- Receives an array of numbers
- Finds the maximum value using only loops
- Returns the maximum

---

### 5️⃣ Reverse an Array
Create a function that:
- Receives an array
- Returns a **new reversed array**
- Do not modify the original array

---

### 6️⃣ Count Occurrences
Create a function that:
- Receives an array and a value
- Counts how many times the value appears
- Returns the count

---

### 7️⃣ String Iteration
Create a function that:
- Receives a string
- Counts how many characters it contains
- Do not use `.length`

---

### 8️⃣ Character Frequency
Create a function that:
- Receives a string
- Returns an object with each character and its count
- Use only loops

---

### 9️⃣ Pattern Generator
Create a function that:
- Receives a number `n`
- Prints the following pattern:

For `n = 4`:
```
*
**
***
****
```

---

### 🔟 Nested Loops Challenge
Create a function that:
- Receives a number `n`
- Prints a square of `n x n` using `#`

For `n = 3`:
```

## 📚 Rules Recap
❌ No conditionals  
❌ No array methods  
❌ No `.length` (where specified)  

✅ Only loops  
✅ Only functions  

---

## 🚀 Bonus (Expert)
- Implement all functions without using `break` or `continue`
- Analyze time complexity of each function in comments
- Solve all exercises using only `while` loops
